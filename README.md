# wgdash (WIP)

This will eventually be a wireguard management dashboard.

I like wireguard a lot. But it's a little painful to use via the CLI,
especially when adding new peers, and for my small-ish use-case.

Wireguard will be used as a VPN gateway here, not via a Point-to-Point method.
As such, I assume we will be running our own DNS here.
